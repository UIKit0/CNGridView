It has full delegate and dataSource support with method calls just like known from [NSTableView](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html) and [UITableView](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html).\r\n\r\n![CNGridView Example Application](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/34133216/WebImages/Github/CNGridView-Example.png)\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\nTo use `CNGridView` the easy work is done in a few steps:\r\n\r\n- open InterfaceBuilder and select your NIB file that should contain the grid view\r\n- Drag a `NSScrollView` to your target view, and set the class of `NSScrollView`'s content view to `CNGridView`\r\n- connect the delegate & dataSource\r\n- implement all required delegate/dataSource methods\r\n\r\nNow you have a fully functionable grid view. `CNGridView` offers a bunch of properties you can change to customize the layout and behavior.\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\nThe documentation of this project is auto generated using [Appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) by [@gentlebytes](https://twitter.com/gentlebytes).
