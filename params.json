It has full delegate and dataSource support with method calls just like known from [NSTableView](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html) and [UITableView](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html).\r\n\r\nThe main inspiration to develop this control came fom @JustSid who wrote the [JUCollectionView](https://github.com/JustSid/JUCollectionView). But `CNGridView` was written from ground up, it uses ARC and has a bunch of properties to customize its layout and behavior.\r\n\r\n`CNGridView` was only testet on 10.7 Lion & 10.8 Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n![CNGridView Example Application](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/34133216/WebImages/Github/CNGridView-Example.png)\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\nTo use `CNGridView` the easy work is done in a few steps:\r\n\r\n- open InterfaceBuilder and select your NIB file that should contain the grid view\r\n- drag a `NSScrollView` to your target view, and set the class of `NSScrollView`'s content view to `CNGridView`\r\n- connect the delegate & dataSource\r\n- implement all required delegate/dataSource methods and fill it with appropriate content.\r\n\r\nNow you have a fully functionable grid view.\r\n\r\n###Missing Features\r\nThere are some features I planned to integrate - if time permits.\r\n* Drag & Drop\r\n* keyboard control\r\n* custom views for grid view items\r\n* custom views for grid view header & footer\r\n* sections\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas of features you are missing, or you wanna contribute this project, please let me know. Feedback is very welcome.
